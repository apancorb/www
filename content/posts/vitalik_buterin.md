## ü§ù I Met Vitalik Buterin

It was brief, but surreal. I met **Vitalik Buterin** ‚Äî the co-creator of Ethereum
and one of the most influential figures in the blockchain world.

We exchanged a few words, and while the moment was short, it left a strong
impression. He‚Äôs calm, thoughtful, and exactly as focused as you'd imagine someone
carrying the weight of an entire ecosystem would be.

Just wanted to mark this moment. One of those quiet highlights in a life built
around code and, well, blockchain :)

## üñãÔ∏è The Bitcoin White Paper

This happened during **ETHGlobal Taipei**, at the **Pragma** event ‚Äî a more intimate builder-focused day before the main hackathon.

I had traveled all the way from Spain, carrying something I really wanted him to sign: an art-printed version of the original **Bitcoin white paper**.

Right after his talk, before the crowd closed in, I approached him ‚Äî and got the signature.

Today, that signed white paper hangs proudly on my wall, framed. A unique piece of crypto history‚Ä¶ and a personal memory I‚Äôll never forget.

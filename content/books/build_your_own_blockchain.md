[This](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-40142-9) book provides a
comprehensive introduction to blockchain and distributed ledger technology.
Intended as an applied guide for hands-on practitioners, the book includes
detailed examples and in-depth explanations of how to build and run a blockchain
from scratch. Through its conceptual background and hands-on exercises, this book
allows students, teachers and crypto enthusiasts to launch their first blockchain
while assuming prior knowledge of the underlying technology.

How do I build a blockchain? How do I mint a cryptocurrency? How do I write a smart
contract? How do I launch an initial coin offering (ICO)? These are some of questions
this book answers. Starting by outlining the beginnings and development of early
cryptocurrencies, it provides the conceptual foundations required to engineer secure
software that interacts with both public and private ledgers. The topics covered include
consensus algorithms, mining and decentralization, and many more.

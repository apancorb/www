[Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies](https://bitcoinbook.cs.princeton.edu/)
provides a comprehensive introduction to the revolutionary yet often misunderstood
new technologies of digital currency. Whether you are a student, software developer,
tech entrepreneur, or researcher in computer science, this authoritative and
self-contained book tells you everything you need to know about the new global
money for the Internet age.

How do Bitcoin and its blockchain actually work? How secure are your bitcoins?
How anonymous are users of cryptocurrencies? Can cryptocurrencies be regulated?
These are some of the many questions this book answers. It begins by tracing the
history and development of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and then gives the
conceptual and practical foundations you need to engineer secure software that
interacts with the Bitcoin network as well as to integrate ideas from Bitcoin
into your own projects. Topics include decentralization, mining, the politics of
Bitcoin, altcoins and the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the future of Bitcoin, and more.

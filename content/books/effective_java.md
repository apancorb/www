Since this Jolt-award winning classic was last updated in 2008, the Java programming
environment has changed dramatically. Java 7 and Java 8 introduced new features and
functions including, `forEach()` method in Iterable interface, default and static
methods in Interfaces, Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions, Java Stream API
for Bulk Data Operations on Collections, Java Time API, Collection API improvements,
Concurrency API improvements, and Java IO improvements.

In this new edition of Effective Java, Bloch explores new design patterns and language
idioms that have been introduced since the second edition was released in 2008 shortly
after Java SE6, including Lambda, streams, generics and collections, as well as selected
Java 9 features.

As in previous editions, each chapter consists of several “items” presented in the
form of a short, standalone essay that provides specific advice, insight into Java
platform subtleties, and updated code examples. The comprehensive descriptions and
explanations for each item illuminate what to do, what not to do, and why.

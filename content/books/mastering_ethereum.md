If you're looking to get started with the Ethereum protocol -- or are among the many
open source developers, integrators, and system administrators already working with
this platform -- *Mastering Ethereum* is the definitive book on the topic. 

Ethereum represents the gateway to a worldwide, decentralized computing paradigm.
This platform enables you to run decentralized applications (DApps) and smart
contracts that have no central points of failure or control, integrate with a
payment network, and operate on an open blockchain. With this practical guide,
Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood provide everything you need to know about
building smart contracts and DApps on Ethereum and other virtual-machine blockchains.

Discover why IBM, Microsoft, NASDAQ, and hundreds of other organizations are
experimenting with Ethereum. This essential guide shows you how to develop the
skills necessary to be an innovator in this growing and exciting new industry.

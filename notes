* Hashcash and relation to Bitcoin
- Read the paper and see the proof-of-work relation
- Hashcash was the original application of proof-of-work

* Blockchain where does it come from?
- Read the paper on bitstrings and see the relation
- maybe include as data structure and network in general

* Birthday problem
- relation to hash functions
- also use birthday attack problem present in end of chapter 1

* Pigeonhole Principle
- relation to hash functions

* Basic example of how Bitcoin script works

* Soft fork vs Hard Fork

* Turing completeness in Ethereum
- what is it
- intro in bitcoin book
- the example of namecoin
- bitcoin limitation of scrypt and platform

* CAP for Blockchain

# Book

* P. Wayner. Digital Cash: commerce on the net (2nd ed). Morgan Kaufmann, 1997
- An accessible overview of digital cash schemes focused on practical issues.
- Showing readers how to exchange digital cash via the Net, this book describes
  a variety of digital cash algorithms, whose approaches get more complex as
  features are added. Several current commercial digital cash systems--Citibank,
  Microsoft/Visa, Digicash, Magic Money, and First Virtual -- are discussed.
- History related (long road to Bitcoin).

# Paper

* D. Chaum, A. Fiat, M. Naor. Untraceable electronic cash. CRYPTO 1998
- Although not Chaum’s earliest paper on e-cash, this is arguably the most
  innovative, and it formed a template replicated by many other papers.
- History related (long road to Bitcoin).

* J. Camenisch, S. Hohenberger, A. Lysyanskaya, Compact e-cash. Theory and Applications of
  Cryptographic Techniques, 2005
- Many papers improved the efficiency of Chaum-Fiat-Naor using modern cryptographic techniques,
  but arguably the most significant is this one.

* B. Schoenmakers. Basic security of the ecash payment system. State of the Art in Applied
  Cryptography, 1997.
- An overview of the implementation of Chaum’s ecash proposal.

  Zerocash have the most complex cryptography of any scheme we’ve discussed in this book.
